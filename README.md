This project is a simple website that displays some delicious recipes for anyone to make and enjoy. 

Skills I've learned and gained throughout the project : 
 - setting up the HTML boilerplate structure by using the shortcut (!).
 - Using ordered and unordered lists to display ingredients and the steps to make them. 
 - inserting and displaying images.
 - linking one webpage to another with attributes.
